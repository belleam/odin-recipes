    <h2>Kickstart the day with this spring vegetable frittata</h2>
    <p>Make sure all your vegetables are tender, hot, and well seasoned before adding your eggs and you'll be good to go.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large leek (white part only), chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (1/2-inch) sliced zucchini</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (1/2-inch) pieces asparagus</li>
            <li>1 cup baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sliced cooked potatoes</li>
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 ounces crumbled goat-milk feta cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook leek with a pinch of salt, stirring occasionally, until leeks soften and start to turn translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add jalapeno and zucchini; season with pinch of salt. Cook until zucchini start to get tender and pale green, about 5 minutes. Add asparagus and cook until bright green, about 1 minute. Add spinach and another pinch of salt, cooking until wilted, 1 minute. Stir in cooked potatoes and heat through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack 12 large eggs into a bowl. Add cayenne, salt, and pepper. Whisk for at least 30 seconds. Pour eggs into over vegetables in skillet over medium heat. Add 3 ounces of crumbled goat cheese; stir lightly until evenly distributed. Top with remaining cheese. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until eggs are set, 12 to 15 minutes. When nearly set, turn on broiler. Broil frittata until top browns, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool slightly; serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
